# Predicting the Solubility of Chemical Compounds Based on their Molecular Descriptors #

## Siva Sricharan Dasaka ##

The dataset, "delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv", contains molecular descriptors and experimentally measured solubility values (logS) for a set of chemical compounds. Molecular descriptors are numerical representations of chemical structures that capture various properties of the molecules.

Solubility refers to the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent (usually water) to form a homogeneous solution. In the context of this dataset, solubility values are expressed in logarithmic scale as logS. LogS is a common way to represent solubility data because it often spans several orders of magnitude, and using a logarithmic scale can make the data more manageable and interpretable.

Positive LogS: Indicates compounds that are more soluble in water. Higher positive values represent higher solubility.

Negative LogS: Indicates compounds that are less soluble in water. Lower negative values represent lower solubility.
